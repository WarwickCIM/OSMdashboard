<p>This package ins highly influenced by the 6 design principles for
feminist data visualisations proposed by Catherine d’Ignazio and Lauren
F. Klein <span class="citation">(2016, 2020)</span>. In this page we
explain how we are addressing each of these principles in the design of
this package and its main output, the dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="rethinking-binaries">Rethinking Binaries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rethinking-binaries"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A feminist approach to data visualization should therefore emphasize
representational strategies premised on multiplicity rather than
binaries, and acknowledge the limits of any binaristic view. – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein (2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, map contributions have been considered the main (or
even the only) way of contributing to OSM. This shadows other ways of
contributing while suggesting that alternative contributions are second
to map contributions. We are incorporating a diversity of contribution
types that recongises this diversity in OSM contributions (see
<code><a href="../articles/dashboard-group-contributions.html">vignette("dashboard-group-contributions")</a></code> for a detailed
list of contributions types being recognised in the dashboard).</p>

<h2 id="embrace-pluralism">Embrace pluralism<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#embrace-pluralism"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that self-disclosure, and an embrace of pluralism more
generally, can do more; it can help to encourage alternatives to the
single “view from nowhere” so often favored in visualization design.
Ideally, a focus on pluralism would help visualization research move
away from its current emphasis on “objective” presentation in favor of
designs that facilitate pathways to multiple truths. – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein (2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This package is the result of a participatory design process with
members of <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:LatAm/Grupos/GeoChicas" class="external-link">Geochicas</a><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Geochicas is a collective of feminist women linked to
OpenStreetMap, originally Spanish-speaking, who work for women’s
empowerment and the reduction of the gender gap in OpenStreetMap
communities and in communities associated with the world of free
software and open data.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> and
researchers from the University of Warwick, who happen to be long-term
OSM contributors.</p>
<p>People involved in the design process and implementation of this
package provide from a diversity of geographies, cultures, genders,
sexual orientations and ethnicities, and have different levels of
seniority and experience with OSM and data visualisation. We’ve made a
conscious effort to create a safe, caring and collaborative environment
where each member has been able to contribute to the shaping of this
project. We have embraded diversity to ensure that the package and its
outputs are relevant and useful for a wider audience.</p>

</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A feminist approach to data visualization therefore acknowledges the
user as a source of knowledge in the design as well as the reception of
any visual interface. The creation of knowledge is, after all, always a
shared endeavor. – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein
(2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project is a research output of the project <em><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/research/digital-good-neutrality-osm" class="external-link">“Can
digital goods be neutral? Evaluating OpenStreetMap’s equity through
participatory data visualisation”</a></em> led by Carlos Cámara-Menoyo
and Timothy Monteath and funded by the <a href="https://digitalgood.net/" class="external-link">ESRC Digital Good Network</a> through
their Digital Good Research Fund 2024-25. The aims of the project are
clearly aligned with this principle and are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>To critically enquiry about neutrality as an aspiration and guiding
principle for digital goods,</li>
<li>To challenge the positivist dominant approach to digital goods by
proposing alternative aspirations and expectations for digital goods,
guided by equity principles.</li>
<li>To influence an existing digital good by campaigning for the
inclusion of equity considerations in their governance.</li>

<h2 id="consider-context">Consider context<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#consider-context"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A feminist approach to data visualization must therefore consider how
diverse contexts can influence the production of a visualization, and
think through the various ways in which any particular visualization
output might be received. – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein
(2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are aiming to appeal to a diverse audience, not necessarily
experts in OSM or data visualisation. Therefore, we have paid speciall
attention to make this as accessible as possible, as follows:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-visualisation-types">Data Visualisation types<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-visualisation-types"></a>
</h3>
<p>Favouring well-known visualisation types (e.g. bar charts, line
charts, maps) over more complex or novel visualisations that may be
harder to interpret or require a higher level of data literacy that may
not always be realistic to expect from the audience.</p>
<p>As an example, while we initially considered using boxplots to
represent the distribution of several metrics in order to understand how
homogeneous or heterogeneous a group is, we finally opted for
histograms, which are more widely known and easier to interpret.</p>
<p>TODO: screenshot of boxplot vs histogram (before and after)</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="colour-palette">Colour palette<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#colour-palette"></a>
</h3>
<p>To improve accessibility of the visualisations, a colour blindness
friendly colour palette was adopted from <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&amp;scheme=PuOr&amp;n=4" class="external-link">Color
Brewer 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>Neutral colours, Purple and Orange, not associated with gender, race
or other aspects were chosen for the visualisations.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="legitimize-embodiment-and-affect">Legitimize Embodiment and Affect<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#legitimize-embodiment-and-affect"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With the rise of popular forms of visualization such as data
journalism, designers have begun to intentionally leverage affect in
order to create an emotional bond with a story or issue, or to engage
and impress readers with beauty and complexity. These affective
dimensions of visualization have been under-explored in traditional
visualization research. Acknowledging the importance of embodiment and
affect also has implications for how we evaluate visualizations. – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein (2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TODO: explain how we are trying to get an understanding of the
interests and motivations of the groups by looking at the types of keys
used, or the hashtags. Not just listing and counting, but also
structuring them and classifying, to surface stories, interests and
motivations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="make-labor-visible">Make labor visible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#make-labor-visible"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Starting with questions of data provenance helps to credit the
bodies that make visualization possible – the bodies that collect the
data, that digitize them, that clean them, and that maintain them.
However, most data provenance research focuses on technical rather than
human points of origination and integration. With its emphasis on
under-valued forms of labor, a feminist approach to visualization can
help to render visible the bodies that shape and care for data at every
stage of the process. This relates to the concept of provenance rhetoric
in which authors of narrative visualizations cite data sources and
methods which may help build credibility with the audience.” – <span class="citation">d’Ignazio and Klein (2016)</span>, p. 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project welcomes any type of contributions, not just coding. It
follows the <a href="https://allcontributors.org" class="external-link">all-contributors</a>
specification as a way to recognise that, while crediting all
contributors.</p>
<p>All contributors are listed in the project’s <a href="https://warwickcim.github.io/OSMdashboard/"><code>README</code></a>
file. All the authors, maintainers and collaborators of this package are
listed in the DESCRIPTION file, and the package’s website (<a href="https://warwickcim.github.io/OSMdashboard/" class="uri">https://warwickcim.github.io/OSMdashboard/</a>).</p>
